Abstract
Abstract of Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion (arXiv:1706.02263):
We consider matrix completion for recommender systems from the point of view of link prediction on graphs. Interaction data such as movie ratings can be represented by a bipartite user-item graph with labeled edges denoting observed ratings. Building on recent progress in deep learning on graph-structured data, we propose a graph auto-encoder framework based on differentiable message passing on the bipartite interaction graph.</description></item><item><title>Multivariate Time-series Forecasting Using GNN</title><link>https://neuronstar.github.io/cpe/28.gnn-time-series-forecasting/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neuronstar.github.io/cpe/28.gnn-time-series-forecasting/</guid><description>Our topic for this session is Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for multivariate time-series forecasting (arXiv:2103.07719).
Abstract
Abstract of Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for multivariate time-series forecasting (arXiv:2103.07719):
Multivariate time-series forecasting plays a crucial rolein many real-world ap-plications. It is a challenging problem as one needs to consider both intra-seriestemporal correlations and inter-series correlations simultaneously. Recently, there have been multiple works trying to capture both correlations, but most, if not allof them only capture temporal correlations in the time domain and resort to pre-defined priors as inter-series relationships.</description></item></channel></rss>
