## When and How

The discussions are hosted online in Lark/Wechat.

- [Lark](https://www.feishu.cn/) is our primary communication channel.
- Wechat is mostly for our backup plans.

If you would like to be part of the party, please create a post here on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/neuronstar/seminar-discussions/discussions/categories/papers-please).

The discussions are mostly in Chinese.

### When

This is a bi-weekly meetup.

There are two different ways to keep track of the upcoming events:

1. add this ics to your calendar.
   - [Calendar ics url](https://outlook.live.com/owa/calendar/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/8455418e-3cff-4bcd-aa40-34b06bce6053/cid-68E8EF2C5F954378/calendar.ics): Add this ICS to your calendar app to follow the upcoming events.
2. If you would like to add individual events by yourself, use the "**Add to Calendar**" button on the specific event page.
   - Here is the button: {{< figure src="../assets/add-to-calendar-demo.png" >}}



As a preview of the events, here is a calendar web page for the upcoming events ([Calendar Page](https://outlook.live.com/owa/calendar/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/8455418e-3cff-4bcd-aa40-34b06bce6053/cid-68E8EF2C5F954378/index.html)):

### Rules

- Everyone shall get their chance to lead the discussion.
- The first principle is to understand the content. Interrupt and ask any questions to make sure we all understand the content well.



## Why this Topic

Conditional probability estimation is one of the most fundamental problems in statistics.

- Conditional probability estimation is frequently used in solving both real life and academic problems. One is likely to encounter this problem at some point of their life.
- If you are inferring, you are probably using conditional probabilities. It is a perspective.
- There are many models and methods to estimate the conditional probability. We can learn about and from these models and methods.
- We need a universal model to solve this problem for productivity. A universal model for this task will save us a lot of time and energy.
- Many machine learning methods are based on conditional probabilities.
  - Many classifiers
  - Bayesian networks
  - ...


## What is Our Approach

- Read and Discuss
- Apply on toy problems


### Reading List and References

We will update this list on our way forward. [Here is a partial list of references](/cpe/00.references/).

{{< card title="Initial Proposal (Outdated)" >}}

As a start this is an outline of what should be covered.

- What is the conditional probability?
  - Sampling theory
  - Bayes
  - Representation of a conditional probability
- Statistical methods to estimate the conditional probability
  - The list is enormous. We will only concentrate on the basics.
- Tree-based
  - Tree as "clustering" method
  - Application on the bike-sharing problem
- NN-based
  - NN as feature transformations
  - Application on the bike-sharing problem
- EM Methods
- Variational Methods
- Normalizing Flow
- To be added as we learn more about it

{{< card title="oy Problems (Outdated)" >}}

We have prepared dataset that can be used both for classification problems and regression problems.
