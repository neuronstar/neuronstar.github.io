Abstract
Abstract of Inferring causal impact using Bayesian structural time-series models (arXiv:1506.00356):
An important problem in econometrics and marketing is to infer the causal impact that a designed market intervention has exerted on an outcome metric over time. This paper proposes to infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion-regression state-space model that predicts the counterfactual market response in a synthetic control that would have occurred had no intervention taken place.</description></item></channel></rss>
